- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LoganStoltz! 
- I'm a passionate Computer Science graduate with a minor in Cyber Security, and I'm currently working toward earning my AWS certifications. 
- In September 2023, I married the love of my life, who Iâ€™ve been with for over since my softmore year of highschool 2017. To top it all off, weâ€™re excited to be expecting our first baby in March of 2025.
- When I'm not coding, you'll find me outdoors or playing video games, whether it's skiing in the winter or camping during the warmer months. I believe that balance is key, and I love combining my love for technology with my passion for nature.
- I'm actively seeking an internship opportunity to launch my career. I'm always open to collaborating on coding projects, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together!
- Reach me with my email: loganstoltz1234@gmail.com
